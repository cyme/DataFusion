# What is DataFusion?

DataFusion is a real-time mobile data syncing service.
The project is currently in construction.
It is partly based on an earlier experiment [SyncLib](https://github.com/cyme/SyncLib.git),
which explored the limitations of server-less data syncing.


# Organization

DataFusion consists in the following sub-projects:

`data-fusion-server`: [Node-js server](https://github.com/cyme/data-fusion-server.git)

`DataFusionKit`: [iOS SDK](https://github.com/cyme/DataFusionKit.git)

More information is provided in the sub-project folders.
